    <p>
        Everybody knows the classic "half your age plus seven" dating rule that a lot of people follow (including myself). <br>
        It's the 'recommended' age range in which to date someone.<br>
        <br>
        minimum age <= your age <= maximum age<br>
        <br>
        Task<br>
        Given an integer (1 <= n <= 100) representing a person's age, return their minimum and maximum age range.<br>
        <br>
        This equation doesn't work when the age <= 14, so use this equation instead:<br>
        <br>
        min = age - 0.10 * age<br>
        max = age + 0.10 * age<br>
        You should floor all your answers so that an integer is given instead of a float (which doesn't represent age). <br>
        Return your answer in the form [min]-[max]<br>
        <br>
        ##Examples:<br>
        <br>
        age = 27   =>   20-40<br>
        age = 5    =>   4-5<br>
        age = 17   =>   15-20<br>
    </p>
